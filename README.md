This project was done as a part of an University project. 
It was designed to test understanding of how MongoDB and NoSQL databases in general, work.

Also, within the project, there are MapReduce files which contain code for two different Map Reduce files, who are supposed to be applied over the created database within the project.

The code is far from perfect, but it is functional.
